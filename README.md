Description: SketchUp is useful from the first stages of design to the end of construction. Programming, diagramming, design development, detailing, documentation, information requests - everywhere you need drawings, you need SketchUp Pro.

Who here wanted sophisticated CAD software? SketchUp Pro is undoubtedly the most intuitive and easy to learn 3D drawing tool available.

We designed SketchUp to be an extension of your hand so that you can draw anything and how you want.

SketchUp is accurate to one thousandth of an inch, so you can design, parameterize and plan with the amount of detail you need.

SketchUp is not only suitable for creating three-dimensional models. With LayOut, you can draw plans, facades, details, name blocks on drawings, and more. When you change the model, your document will also update. It's simple.

With LayOut, you have everything you need to create page designs, sketches, vector illustrations, and presentations - everything you need to explain everything.

Use SketchUp Pro to turn your models into animated walk-throughs and flyovers that showcase every detail.
